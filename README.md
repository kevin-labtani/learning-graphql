# Learning GraphQL

This is the repo for the fullstack app I coded while learning graphql along frontendmasters videos.

## Definition

A spec that describes a declarative query language that your clients can use to ask an API for the exact data they want. This is achieved by creating a strongly typed Schema for your API, ultimate flexibility in how your API can resolve data, and client queries validated against your Schema.

## Server Side

- Type Definitions
- Resolvers
- Query Definitions
- Mutation Definitions
- Composition
- Schema

## Client Side

- Query
- Mutations
- Fragments

### Schemas

Creating a Schema:

- Using Schema Definition Language (SDL)
- Programmatically Creating a Schema using language constructs

Using SDL, the basic parts:

- Types - a construct defining a shape with fields
- Fields - keys on a Type that have a name and a value type
- Scalars - primitive value type built into GraphQL
- Query - type that defines how clients can access data
- Mutation - type that defines how clients can modify or create data
